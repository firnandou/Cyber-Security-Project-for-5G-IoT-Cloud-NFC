#####Title:

Cyber security evaluation and mitigation for future wireless networks, 5G, IoT, NTC and cloud storage systems (An Offensive and Defensive Technical Approach)

######Problem statement:

It is worth acknowledging that, the high data rates required for the increasing demands for real-time communication, VR and AR, Big-data, NFC and IoT, not forgetting streaming services have been achieved. As I speak, 5G is on trial in most parts of Africa. However, to a narrow view, there are three-four fundamental requirements for a modern communication network, which include, Data rate/throughput capacity, Processing power of equipment, Redundancy, and cyber-security that contribute to QoS Realization. I have singled out cyber-security to be my center of discussion, all said, the security of the huge amounts of data put on the network; in transit, and in cloud and other storage servers on the network has to be handled with great concern.

######Justification:

I have taken on the challenge to evaluate, and make an inquiry in possible cyber security mitigation in wireless networks and cloud systems, with emerging IoT systems, automation of different activities in health, agriculture, government, mobile banking/mobile money and education(e-learning platforms ), all of which require internet connectivity, security of data transfers should be ensured, hackers can cost a company a great deal of money, reputation, and test its competence to protecting the information of its customers.

#####Scope:

1. Encryption algorithms
2. History of hacking and Ethical hacking
3. Tools used in penetration testing, social engineering and vulnerability tests with kali linux for wireless networks
4. Security with python programming
5. Security in the application layer and network layer (ipv4 and ipv6) analysis with wireshark
6. Tools and remedies to secure systems (Unix, Cisco, Juniper and Hauwei hardware systems)
7. 5G, IoT, NFC, Smart grid cyber security and cloud storage security concerns
8. Cyber security international and national policies and very activities, including the GDPR
9. Future discussions on computer security
