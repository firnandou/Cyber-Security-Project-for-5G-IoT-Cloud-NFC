#####Title:

Cyber security evaluation and mitigation for future 5G wireless networks; IoT, NFC and cloud storage systems
(An Offensive and Defensive Technical Approach)

######Problem statement:

The increasing demands for real-time communication/ streaming services , VR and AR, NFC, smart grid and IoT/ IoE that put all kinds of data on a network from health, agriculture, education, etc and the effort of the government to digitize all communication, and aslo the increasing electronic money transfers, all these generate huge amounts of data, hence Big-data, this poses a problem that preambles security of networks, I have singled out cyber-security to be my center of my discussion, research and inquiry, all said, the security of the huge amounts of data put on the network; in transit, and in cloud and other storage servers on the network has to be handled with great concern.

######Justification:

I have taken on the challenge to evaluate, and make an inquiry in possible cyber security mitigation in wireless networks and cloud systems, with emerging IoT systems, automation of different activities in health, agriculture, government, mobile banking/mobile money and education(e-learning platforms ), all of which require internet connectivity, security of data transfers should be ensured, hackers can cost a company a great deal of money, reputation, and test its competence to protecting the information of its customers.

#####Scope:

The following practical activities will be carried out during the course of the project
:
Wireless Encryption algorithms, munged passwords with MATLAB
History of hacking and Ethical hacking.
Tools used in penetration testing, social engineering and vulnerability tests with kali linux for wireless networks.
Security models with GNS3 simulation
Security with python programming.
Security in the application layer and network layer (ipv4 and ipv6) analysis with wireshark, (software systems security).
Tools and remedies to secure hardware systems (Unix, Cisco, Juniper and Hauwei hardware systems).
5G, IoT, NFC, Smart grid cyber security and cloud storage security concerns.
Cyber security policies, including the GDPR. And UGCERT activity review
