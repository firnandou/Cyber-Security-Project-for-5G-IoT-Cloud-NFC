#####Title:

Cyber security evaluation and mitigation for future 5G wireless networks; IoT, NFC and cloud computing systems
(An Offensive and Defensive Technical Approach)

######Abstract:
5G  is proposed to be launched by 2020. 5G and other subsequent  next generation networks will be characterized by; low latency, improved throughput, low transmit-recieve power, and consequently improved QoS. mmwave, MU-MIMO, SDR(C-RAN), MEC, NFV, and SDN are the technologies that have been proposed , with IoT and Cloud computing as the major enablers. Due to softwarization (SDN), and network slicing(NFV), new cyber security threat vectors, are introduced. For 5G to be cloud native and support IoT, will require a proper security architecture be developed to ensure total QoS. In this paper, I will cover; (1) The basic cyber security concepts, like; risk management, assurance, secSDLC models, encryption and ACs models,  the 5G, IoT and Cloud computing security architectures/frameworks, and cyber policy of Uganda, and the USA. (2)  For each of the architectures, I shall demonstrate the countermeasures to the threat vectors cited, demonstrate network security techniques , and encryption algorithms. The former will be theoretical, while the latter will be a practical demo of cyber security tools, ie Defensive (Proactive), and Offensive (Reactive).

Key terms: secSDLC, 5G, 3GPP, 5GPPP, mmwave, MEC, NFV, SDN, SDR, IoT, ACs, eMBB, mMTC, uRLLC, PaaS, IaaS, SaaS, smart city, smart grid, smart home, etc

######Problem statement:

The increasing demands for real-time communication/ streaming 4k videos, gaming , VR, MR and AR and IoT (smart home,  smart grid, smart city, v2x) that put a constraint on traditional storage, raising need for cloud computing. The data on a network includes personal health data, agriculture, education, e-government, e-commerce including, the increasing electronic money transfers etc, with the effort of the government to digitize all communication. All these services , and efforts generate huge amounts of data, Big-data, this poses a problem ensuring cyber security. I have singled out cyber-security to be the focus of this paper. The security of data on the network both in transit, and in cloud has to be handled with great concern. 5G is proposed to be rolled-out by 2020, I advocate for a secure architecture, by reviewing the security  frameworks and models.
